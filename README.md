# DENAVES

Let's make a shmup game in a couple of days!

## Goals
- Make a fun simple shmup with as many features of the genre as possible
- Develop a process for making games quickly
- Document my process using version control
- Learn to be more public about my process

## About the project
DENAVES is my take on a simple shmup game that showcases many of the features of the genre, for educative and fun purposes. I want to learn and help others learn the basics of shmups, and how they can be implemented quickly. In a way, I want to develop an 'Instant shmup recipe' that tastes good and is easy to make.

With such a recipe, we all can have a backup plan when we want to show up for a game jam but don't have the time, the inspiration, or the energy to stress out over a game jam. Sometimes, I'd rather make something well within my comfort zone and feel good about having made a new game than come up with a good new game idea. So let's create that comfort zone.

I've chosen the shmup genre mainly because it's one of the easiest types of games to make, but also because of its very long tradition. Most people including game designers such as myself are not aware of the many interesting game rules that have been incorporated into the shmup vocabulary over the decades and have a very superficial knowledge of shmups.


## Game Idea
This game draws inspiration mainly from the 19xx and Sonic Wings series, and will include the following elements:
- Auto-scrolling background: Player controls a plane flying over an earth-like environment and confronting other military type vehicles
- Vertical scrolling: Enemies keep spawning from the top and the sides of the screen.
- Projectile Weapon: Just a simple vertical projectile weapon (no homing missiles, spread guns, lasers...).
- Auto-shooting: Button mashing is outdated.
- One-hit Death: The plane dies when hit by any projectile, respawns in place.
- Power-ups: players can collect items to increase the power level of the plane's weapon.
- Bombs: players can collect and use bombs to clear the screen of enemies and bullets and escape hairy situations.
- Options: options are satellital aircraft that follow the plane and add increased firepower
- Small hitbox: the plane's hitbox is trimmed down so it's easier to dodge enemy projectiles
- Rank: game difficulty adjusted to the player performance
- Score: player obtains points by killing enemies and collecting items. Dying clears the score. Extra lives are awarded after surpassing certain tresholds.
- Loops: the game can be replayed from the start indefinitely after clearing all the enemies, until the player loses.
- Different types of enemies: including "popcorn" enemies that are very satisfying to kill in huge numbers, mid-bosses.
- Boss Fight: with several parts to destroy.
The game will only have one level.
