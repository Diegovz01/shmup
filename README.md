# DENAVES

Let's make a shmup game in a couple of days!

## Goals
- Make a fun simple shmup with as many features of the genre as possible
- Develop a process for making games quickly
- Document my process using version control
- Learn to be more public about my process

## About the project
DENAVES is my take on a simple shmup game that showcases many of the features of the genre, for educative and fun purposes. I want to learn and help others learn the basics of shmups, and how they can be implemented quickly. In a way, I want to develop an 'Instant shmup recipe' that tastes good and is easy to make.

With such a recipe, we all can have a backup plan when we want to show up for a game jam but don't have the time, the inspiration, or the energy to stress out over a game jam. Sometimes, I'd rather make something well within my comfort zone and feel good about having made a new game than come up with a good new game idea. So let's create that comfort zone.

I've chosen the shmup genre mainly because it's one of the easiest types of games to make, but also because of its very long tradition. Most people including game designers such as myself are not aware of the many interesting game rules that have been incorporated into the shmup vocabulary over the decades and have a very superficial knowledge of shmups.
